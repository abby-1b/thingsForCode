# Pushing numbers to the stack
To push numbers to the stack just write them down.

# Math operators (+-*/=~&|)...
This is a stack-based programming language, so operations are always done on the numbers that are on the stack.

If you want to add up two numbers, just write them down and put the `+` operator after them.
```
5 2 +
```

# Variable declaration (@)
Variables are declared based off of the numbers on the stack. To put the result of the last operation's result into a variable, just write `@` and the variable name.
```
5 2 + @varName
```

# Control flow
