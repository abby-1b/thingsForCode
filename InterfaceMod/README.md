# This is based off of the Fabric Example Mod

## What is this? Looks pretty cheaty.
It is. This is _not_ something to be used for cheating, nothing like that. Eventually I'll display some text all the time indicating that the mod is installed. 

This mod is ***100%*** cheaty. Don't use it for anything other than practice runs.

## Why would you make it?
I needed to practice. I think his is a pretty good balance between the novelty of Random Seed and the precision of Set Seed.
