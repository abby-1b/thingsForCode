# MIT AppInventor Extension
This is a small extension/plugin for MIT AppInventor!

It seeks to implement a text-based editor alongside the block-based editing the normal editor offers.

It supports compiling code to AppInventor blocks and de-compiling the blocks back to usable code.

I feel the need to emphasize that this isn't meant to be used by beginners to learn from zero. This is more of a tool for making the jump from blocks to text smoother, and also helps experienced devs write block code faster.

## Why, again?
It's faster than blocks! Trust me, you don't want to be implementing the quadratic formula in Blockly. With this, you might _not_ hate block-based coding!

## How can I use it?
Look at [`TUTORIAL.md`](TUTORIAL.md) to learn how to use it.
