# MIT AppInventor Extension
This is a small extension for MIT AppInventor that seeks to implement a text-based editor alongside the block based editing the editor offers.

It supports compiling code to AppInventor blocks and de-compiling the blocks back to usable code.

I feel the need to emphasize that this isn't meant to be used by beginners to learn from zero. This is more of a tool for making the jump to coding in text smoother, and also helps experienced devs write block code faster.

## Why, again?
It's faster than blocks! Trust me, you don't want to be implementing the quadratic formula in Blockly (yes, AppInventor is based on Blockly); but with this extension you might _not_ hate coding!

## Dependencies
 - None

That's right, everything this extension uses has been built from scratch. That includes the language (which is custom and has no name), syntax highlighting for said language, translating the language to a set of blocks, and the logic to put all these blocks together.

Syntax highlighting was a nightmare I never want to go through again. 

## How can I use it?
Look at [`TUTORIAL.md`](TUTORIAL.md) to learn how to use it.
